# Password_Manager
This Local Secure Password Manager built within Python and SQL.

Even though im failry certain this is very secure, use at your own risk, I am not responsible for any data breaches as this is meant for a Personal Development Project

This python script is meant to be used with the the rockyou.txt datafile, in which I had SHA-512 hashed for security when comparing passwords. Sadly this file is too big even when zipped. So to get the full
experience (and less buggy/ errored experience) please download the rockyou.txt file, hash each entry and keep within the same directory.
